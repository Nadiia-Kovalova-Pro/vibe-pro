# Test Strategy and Tech Stack for TodoApp Features

## Overview
This document proposes a comprehensive testing strategy for features in the TodoApp, a full-stack application built with Flask (backend) and React/TypeScript (frontend). The strategy covers unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) testing, ensuring code quality, reliability, and maintainability. It aligns with the existing tech stack and focuses on practical implementation.

## Test Types and Matching Tools

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Purpose**: Validate individual units of code (e.g., functions, components, schemas) in isolation to ensure they work as expected without external dependencies.
- **Scope**: 
  - Frontend: React components (e.g., Button, TaskCard), utility functions (e.g., `cn` in `utils.ts`), schemas (e.g., `task-schema.ts`), and hooks.
  - Backend: Utility functions, models, and route helpers.
- **Tools**:
  - **Frontend**: Vitest (already configured in `vitest.config.ts`) + React Testing Library (for component rendering and interactions).
  - **Backend**: pytest (standard for Python/Flask).
- **Example for Button Component Feature**:
  - Test default rendering, variant changes, click events, and prop forwarding.
  - File: `frontend/src/components/ui/button.test.tsx` (already exists as a reference).

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Verify interactions between multiple units, such as API calls, database operations, and component compositions, to ensure seamless data flow.
- **Scope**:
  - Frontend: Component interactions (e.g., TaskCard with EditDialog), API service calls (e.g., `useCreateTaskMutation`), and form submissions.
  - Backend: API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/tasks`), database queries, and authentication flows.
- **Tools**:
  - **Frontend**: Vitest with mocking (e.g., via `vi.mock` for Axios API calls) + React Testing Library for user interactions.
  - **Backend**: pytest with Flask-Testing (for simulating requests and database sessions).
- **Example for Task Creation Feature**:
  - Test form submission, API mutation, and UI updates (e.g., in `create-form.tsx`).

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- **Purpose**: Simulate real user scenarios across the entire application to validate complete workflows, including UI, backend, and database.
- **Scope**:
  - Full user journeys: Authentication (sign-in/sign-up), task management (create, edit, delete), and dashboard navigation.
  - Cross-cutting concerns: Route protection, error handling, and responsive design.
- **Tools**:
  - **Recommended**: Playwright (for browser automation, supports multiple browsers, and integrates well with Vite).
  - **Alternative**: Cypress (if Playwright setup is complex).
- **Example for Authentication Feature**:
  - Test user sign-in, token storage, and protected route access (e.g., from landing to dashboard).

## Tech Stack Details and Setup

### Frontend Tech Stack
- **Unit/Integration**: Vitest (configured in `vitest.config.ts`), React Testing Library (`@testing-library/react`), and jsdom (for DOM simulation).
- **E2E**: Playwright (install via `npm install --save-dev @playwright/test`).
- **Additional Libraries**: `@testing-library/jest-dom` for custom matchers, `user-event` for simulating user actions.

### Backend Tech Stack
- **Unit/Integration**: pytest (install via `pip install pytest`), Flask-Testing (for test clients), and in-memory SQLite for isolated DB tests.
- **E2E**: Playwright can drive full-stack tests by interacting with the frontend while the backend runs.

### Setup Steps
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Frontend: `npm install --save-dev @playwright/test` (for E2E).
   - Backend: `pip install pytest flask-testing`.
2. **Configuration**:
   - Add Playwright config: `npx playwright install` and create `playwright.config.ts` in `frontend/`.
   - Update `package.json` scripts: `"test:e2e": "playwright test"`.
3. **Test Structure**:
   - Unit/Integration: Place in `src/__tests__/` or alongside components (e.g., `button.test.tsx`).
   - E2E: Place in `frontend/tests/` or `e2e/`.

## Implementation Plan and Best Practices
1. **Prioritize Tests**: Start with unit tests for core components (e.g., Button, TaskCard), then integration for APIs, and E2E for critical paths (e.g., task CRUD).
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Run tests in GitHub Actions or similar; use coverage tools (e.g., `vitest --coverage` for frontend).
3. **Mocking**: Use Vitest mocks for external dependencies (e.g., API calls in `services/api/tasks.ts`).
4. **Maintenance**: Keep tests DRY, use descriptive names, and update with code changes.
5. **Coverage Goals**: Aim for 80%+ coverage; focus on business logic over trivial UI.

This strategy ensures robust testing while leveraging the existing setup (e.g., Vitest for frontend). For feature-specific implementations, refer to existing tests like `button.test.tsx`.
